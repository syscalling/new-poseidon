# New Poseidon: Enhanced Efficient Foundation Models for PDEs
This is the enhanced version of the original source code for the paper [*Poseidon: Efficient Foundation Models for PDEs*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19101). This repository also acts as a package if you want to use the enhanced models in your code.

Use the pretrained models and pretraining dataset in our assortment on the [ðŸ¤— Hub â€“ Pretrained Models and Pretraining Datasets](https://huggingface.co/collections/syscalling/new-poseidon-664fa125729c53d8607e209a). All datasets corresponding to downstream tasks can be downloaded from the same collection on the [ðŸ¤— Hub â€“ Downstream Tasks](https://huggingface.co/collections/syscalling/new-poseidon-downstream-tasks-664fa237cd6b0c097971ef14) as well. To use them, follow the corresponding sections below.
